## Accountability

One way to increase awareness is through thinking, thinking can be accelerated through talking with others. By building relationships with other people you can do several things at once:

- you build a framework in which you determine how to best represent yourself
- you model some of your behavior and ability to introspect on problems relative to observation of others
- you create a framework for observing others as well as having something to talk about - something to aspire to
- building relationships allows you to utilize the tools to check in and *be checked in upon*

Sometimes you might have lacked some motivation, or haven't quite committed yourself that you may wish you were otherwise doing. Having a network allows you to push forward in some set of dimensions because there is an underlying assumption that you are worthy of getting better and being okay.
