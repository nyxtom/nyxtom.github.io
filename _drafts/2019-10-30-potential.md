This is just a personal difference of philosophy but I feel obliged to make the case that it isn’t self actualization that is desirable necessarily. I make that case because you yourself have made the claim that it is selfish, that your priority should be to make the world a better place first (in so much that can be defined).

What can be grasped, judging from the premise that the world has suffering and pain, and at times that becomes too much to bear for people (in the form of tragedy), but also in the form of malevolence. Tragedy being something that can be strived to overcome because after all life has limitation and constraints - the goal is to live in spite of those constraints in an effort to make things better. Or rather, to live with your aim up rather than degenerate down into malevolence.

It isn’t self actualization that is concerned, it’s about aiming towards something better across many dimensions. Self actualization is a piece of it, but isn’t the whole point. You might say it begins with the self rather that out in the world. Reduce your own propensity for malevolence. Tell yourself the truth and take care of yourself to put yourself together so to speak. When you are capable enough that you have made habits out of this with ease, your capacity grows outward.

Maybe you are taking care of your home more, maybe you feel like you have enough of your cup filled that you can take care of the attention you give to your children or the kind of attention and education. Perhaps you have enough capacity that you might expand your center out into the community and volunteer, start a business, give back to open source, join a community, lead even.

It isn’t necessarily that these are things are good by the nature of emulation (I.e. a good person does these things) it is a matter of what you value. What you value is directly observable by the evidence of your attention to those dimensions of life. Because it can be observed, you can say that your value system forms a hierarchy because at any given time you can only focus your attention on one thing in an effort to produce potential out of it.

The values are never on equal footing because time is limited, and interests vary across time. This variance produces what might be better known as a community across time. At any given point, the community that exists within the individual has differing motivations to more or less degrees of influence. Conflict arises out of competing interests as efforts to reduce or eliminate obstacles become difficult or out of your control.

Another way of putting this might be - given a value within a hierarchy and an internal motivated interest in that value, when it becomes clear that the potential is not manifesting - one of several things can happen in determining cause and subsequently acting on that.
