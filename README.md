# About

Hi! 👋 You've arrived here either of your own choosing, or you found a reference possibly somewhere on the interweb. In any case, this is my
personal website of my notes and articles. I tend towards computer science, occasionally write about physics, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and every now and then I will muse about my personal goals. You might find some of them useful, some interesting, and some not so much. That's okay. They are mostly for me, but I do like to write with the intent that it will be helpful for other people.

Cheers 🍻
