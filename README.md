# About

Hello, I am a programmer by trade, science educator to my daughter, a runner, and I enjoy all things in nature. This site is my personal website where I discuss my thoughts on computer science, projects I'm experimenting with, and occasional philosphical musings on life. Every now and then I will publish a goals update to keep things up to pace (setting goals in public).

I've worked as a programmer professionally for over 10+ years in data science, medical information processing, social analytics, devops, and realtime collaborative editors. I've taken courses on Machine Learning, Brain Science, and Signal Processing (my personal favorite courses I've taken on Coursera includes [Signals, Neurons, and Brains](https://www.coursera.org/learn/synapses) and [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)). Feel free to browse around my work below!
