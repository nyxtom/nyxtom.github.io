In this series, we're going to be building a full stack single page application (not a todo app) with vanilla javascript, modern css, and a simple Go web server. This won't be easy to say the least. We are all so used to building applications centered around framework choices and using modern build tooling. I want to see if I can demonstrate to newcomers that you don't even need a framework to build something great. 

In fact, if you head into any interview a lot of companies sometimes ask how to build basic functionality that you might of seen or used in *popular framework XYZ*. Learning these fundamentals will help you understand the complexity of these features and it might even help land you a job!

Here's a list of the things we're going to cover:

* Create a simple web server in Go with gofiber
* Server Side Rendering + Basic Route Templates
* SSR (part 2): HTML Template Components + Hydration
* Information Flow and Common Usability Questions (Design)
* Style Re-usability with CSS Root Variables
* Infinitely customizable layouts with CSS Grid
* Using the fetch api to request all the things
* Single Page Application router in vanilla JS
