title: GPX Strava Data
published: true
---

For some time now I've been wanting to write my own [Strava](https://strava.com/) app but I've never gotten around to it. In any case, a simpler approach for now is to - at the very least - catalog my health and run data into my own repository for backup purposes. Strava does provide an api to do this, but it's a bit limiting and doesn't work very well unless you've got a full-fledged oauth webapp deployed - which is a bit annoying. So instead, I've opted to use their **Export** feature to just download all my information once a week.

## GPX

The exported data from strava has a number of csv files (for me most of which are empty). The only ones I'm really interested in are the **activities.csv** and the **activities/*.gpx** files. All the activities are stored in **[GPS Exchange Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format)**.

```markdown
GPS Exchange Format is an XML schema designed as common GPS data format.
It can describe waypoints, tracks, routes and with extensions it will 
store heartrates, speed, elevation data.
```

Exporting my activities data I'm able to see this information in XML.

## GPXSee

[GPXSee](https://github.com/tumic0/GPXSee) is an open-source Qt-based GPS log viewer and analyzer supporting all sorts of GPS log file formats. It works really well and I highly recommend testing it out.

My hope is to dive a bit deeper into GPXSee's implementation and try and build something I can display on here, or export elsewhere. In any case, I've just 
exported all my runs to my [github/nyxtom/runs](https://github.com/nyxtom/runs)
